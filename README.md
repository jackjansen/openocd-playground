# openocd-playground

I'm using this repository to record what I am finding out about using OpenOCD.

It is mainly for my own benefit, but maybe other people will find it useful too.

[esp32/README.md](esp32/README.md>) has information on using an FTDI2232H minimodule to connect to an esp32 for debugging.

[nrf51822/readme.md](nrf51822/readme.md) has info on re-flashing a Bluefruit LE Sniffer from Adafruit.
